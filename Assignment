#My research question


I am selecting NESARC data set survey on Alcohol

1. I want to see if the low educated people are more likely to marry at a younger age than those who have a higher educated.
2. I want to see if people who marry at a young age are more likely to be divorced than the people who marry at a older age.


3 - literature review .
Those who marry young face significant hurdles, including impediments to their educational attainment and the long-term success of their marriage
